# Advanced-Portspoofing-detector
This code incorporates an LSTM-based neural network for real-time port spoofing detection, where network packets are continuously captured and analyzed using the trained model to identify potential port spoofing instances.


Define LSTM-based neural network architecture:

We create a sequential model with an input layer, two LSTM layers, and a dense output layer with a sigmoid activation function.
This architecture allows the model to learn sequential patterns from network traffic data.
Feature extraction and data preprocessing:

We extract relevant features from network packets, including source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and payload size.
If a packet contains IP and TCP layers, we extract these features.
We reshape the features into a suitable format for input to the neural network.
Real-time port spoofing detection using LSTM model:

We define a function to detect port spoofing in real-time using the LSTM model.
The function takes a packet as input, extracts its features, and makes a prediction using the trained LSTM model.
If the prediction probability is above a certain threshold (0.5 in this case), we print a message indicating port spoofing detection.
Packet sniffing thread:

We define a function to start packet sniffing in a separate thread using Scapy.
The function continuously captures packets from the specified network interface and calls the port spoofing detection function for each packet.
Main function:

We define the main function where the execution of the code begins.
We specify the network interface and packet limit for packet sniffing.
We create and compile the LSTM model using the defined architecture.
We start the packet sniffing thread to monitor network traffic for port spoofing.
